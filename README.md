# Cellular Automata 1D
This C# Windows Forms application allows you to simulate and visualize the behavior of a one-dimensional cellular automaton. Cellular automata are discrete mathematical models consisting of a grid of cells, each of which can be in one of several states. In this simulation, we use a one-dimensional grid of cells with binary states (0 or 1) and apply a specific rule to update the cell states over multiple generations.

How to use: In the input field insert a number between 1 and 255.
